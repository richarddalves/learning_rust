# Learning Rust

Repository to document my learning of Rust.

## Structure

The repository is organized by the language of the study material:
- `pt/` - exercises, projects and materials studies in Portuguese
- `en/` - exercises, projects and study materials in English

Within each language folder:
- `exercises/` - practical exercises
- `projects/` - larger and more comprehensive projects

## How to navigate

Each exercise or project folder is an independent Cargo project. Go into the folder and run:

```bash
cargo run
```

## About

I started studying Rust in November 2024. This repository documents part of that journey (from the end of 2025), including attempts, errors, and evolutions.

All code written here is my own (and I will make that explicit if it isn't somewhere). I will try to do everything truly by myself here, including code and documentation, because I believe that this is how my learning and skills will truly solidify.
